don't try to give a intro to regex, casue it is too big a topic. Just mention Ack and grep uses different kind of regex
same applies to grep.

Q: how check only .c files, how to check everything but .c files?
A:

Q: I can not believe it, ack by default ignores file without a decent extention, and what else?
A: Yes, casue "ack defaults to only searching source code" , http://betterthangrep.com/why-ack/
   see also "Why does ack ignore unknown files by default?" man ack-grep

Q: then how to add other type of files into search scope?
A: man ack       

       If you want ack to search files that it doesn't recognize, use the "-a" switch.
       If you want ack to search every file, even ones that it always ignores like coredumps and backup files, use the "-u" switch.

Q: Ack vs grep?
A: Ack is a grep focusing on "source code search", since it sets its focus, so many things can be done easier than grep.
   "Obsoleted most of my 'grep is crippled' wrapper scripts, too." 

Q: So ack is just a grep in limited mode? there is no strong points of ack?
A: Some people think it has perl-regex and it's stronger than gnu-regex,

Q: tell me sth that grep can do while ack can not?
A: that is not even a question, since ack has lots of defaults to optimize source search, so it will become very awkward to use when you are doing sth else. 

Q: can I use grep for source searching?
A: yes, you can, and people do. but it takes quite a bit customization and scripting. You have to know not only grep, but also find and other bash scripting basic skills.
