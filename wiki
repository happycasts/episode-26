   in vim use `:ack -Q "*h"`, the '""' is a must



Q: how check only .c files, how to check everything but .c files?
A:

Q: I can not believe it, ack by default ignores file without a decent extention, and what else?
A: Yes, casue "ack defaults to only searching source code" , http://betterthangrep.com/why-ack/
   see also "Why does ack ignore unknown files by default?" man ack-grep

Q: then how to add other type of files into search scope(--exclude --include)?
A: man ack       

       If you want ack to search files that it doesn't recognize, use the "-a" switch.
       If you want ack to search every file, even ones that it always ignores like coredumps and backup files, use the "-u" switch.

   :Ack --nojs sth


DONT:
    don't try to give a intro to regex, casue it is too big a topic. Just mention Ack and grep uses different kind of regex
    same applies to grep.
    lAck and AckAdd not so sexy
