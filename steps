1. When ack, why not grep?

    Q: can I use grep for source searching?
    A: yes, you can, and people do. but it takes quite a bit customization and
       scripting. You have to know not only grep, but also find and other bash
       scripting basic skills.
       and also grep is usually pre-installed on the system, which ack is not.
    Q: Ack vs grep?
    A: Ack is a grep focusing on "source code search", since it sets its focus, so many things can be done easier than grep.
       "Obsoleted most of my 'grep is crippled' wrapper scripts, too." 
       e.g

    Q: So ack is just a grep in limited mode? there is no strong points of ack?
    A: Some people think it has perl-regex and it's stronger than gnu-regex,

    Q: tell me sth that grep can do while ack can not?
    A: that is not even a question, since ack has lots of defaults to optimize
       source search, so it will become very awkward to use when you are doing
       sth else.
